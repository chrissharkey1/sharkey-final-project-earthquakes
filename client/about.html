            My name is Chris Sharkey and I developed this project to explore earthquake occurrences across the globe
            through visualization.
            This website aims to display the largest earthquakes over history through an interactive mapping interface
            powered by <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>. 
            The data is sourced from the Earthquake Hazards Program from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
            The API they provide to developers is located at 
            <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="about_header">Use</h2>
        <p>
            To use this site, you must first navigate to the home page, where the interactive visualization is located. 
            The map in the center of the page will include all data points of recorded evidence of earthquakes with
            a magnitude above (or equal to) 7.5. Earthquakes over a magnitude of 7.5 or higher are noted as major or 
            great earthquakes that have the potential to cause large amounts of damage. 
            Amazingly, this data actually goes begins at the year 1700!
        </p>
        <p>
            Each circle on the map represents an earthquake, with larger earthquakes having a larger radius. If you
            hover over any circle you will be able to view its relevant data. This includes the coordinates of its
            occurence, the magnitude, the time it occurred, and a description of the location.
        </p>
        <h2 class="about_header">Filtering</h2>
        <p>
            Below the map window there are filters for both the date and magnitude where you will be able to explore the data.
            Magnitudes entered must be numbers (with or without decimals) and the date can follow the MM/DD/YYYY pattern
            as displayed. In order to filter the data based on the magnitude, be sure to include numbers greater than
            7.5 in order to display the desired information, since the lowest magnitude in the dataset is 7.5.
            Once you have decided how to filter the data, click the <i>Filter</i> button and you will receive your results.
        </p>
        <h2>Resetting the data</h2>
        <p>
            After filtering the data, all you need to do to return to the original dataset is click the <i>Reset Data</i>
            button. This will make the visualization zoom back out to the globe view as well.
