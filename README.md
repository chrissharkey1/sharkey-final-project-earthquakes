This project utilizes an API provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program. It allows for querying through geojson data through URL formatting. Documentation: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

The goal of the project is to display the largest earthquakes of the dataset, particularly those with a magnitude of 7.5 and above. Website users have the ability to gather information on and filter pertinent earthquake information to their own interests. Since Earthquakes occur incredibly frequency, contrary to popular belief, data can be difficult to navigate. Visual geolocation is used, as its representation is intuitive and interactive.
